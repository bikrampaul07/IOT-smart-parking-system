# Smart-car-parking-with-IOT-and-RFID

## Introduction
This RFID-Based Car Parking System integrates IoT and RFID technology to manage parking slots and track user information. It uses the Blynk App for real-time monitoring of parking slots and gate control. Additionally, the system logs the entry details (person's name, time, and date) into a Google Sheet each time an RFID cardholder enters the parking lot. This provides a smart and automated solution for parking management with real-time tracking and data logging.

## Features
- RFID-Based Detection: Automatic car detection using unique RFID tags/cards.
- IoT Integration: Real-time slot status display in the Blynk app and remote gate control.
- Google Sheets Logging: Uploads the RFID user's name, entry time, and date into a Google Sheet for record-keeping.
- Real-Time Monitoring: Displays parking slot availability on a 20x4 LCD display and the Blynk app.
- Entry Gate Control: Open and close the entry gate through the Blynk app.
- Full Slot Notification: Displays "All slots booked" message when parking is full.

## Technologies Used
### Hardware:
- ESP microcontroller 
- MFRC522 RFID module
